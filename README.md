Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crud-php.git
Move the project to your web server's root directory.

Create a MySQL database and import the database.sql file to set up the required table.

Configuration
Edit the config.php file to set up the database connection:

php
Copy code
<?php

define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
define('DB_USER', 'your_username');
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'your_password');
define('DB_NAME', 'your_database_name');
